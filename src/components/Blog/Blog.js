                <h4>1. how does react works ?</h4>
                <p>Answer: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 'V' denotes the view in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.</p>
                <h4>2. Difference between props and state.</h4>
                <p>Answer: <br />
                    PROPS:- <br />
                    -The Data is passed from one component to another. <br />
                    -It is Immutable (cannot be modified). <br />
                    -Props can be used with state and functional components. <br />
                    -Props are read-only. <br />
                    STATE:- <br />
                    -The Data is passed within the component only. <br />
                    -	It is Mutable ( can be modified). <br />
                    -State can be used only with the state components/class component (Before 16.0). <br />
                    -	State is both read and write.
                </p>
                <h4>3. What is the use of use effect ?</h4>
                <p>
                    Answer: <br />
                    The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
                    Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.
                    useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
